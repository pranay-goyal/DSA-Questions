118. Pascal's Triangle
Video Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1lj9B33Euc
APPROACH 1:
  -- use two variable , one for rows and one for columns
  -- Iniatialize every row in pascal triangle to 1, using vector which is size of row+1
  -- now in for loop row is started with 0
  -- col is started with 1 but less than row, basically 2 row k baad inner loop kaam karega
  -- then we just need to change the values between both 1 (starting and ending) using formala
  -- here tow change the value we need to access the value in previous row using [row-1] and element inside that row using [col] and [col-1], using this we will get the previous row element whose sum is going to 
      place in the current column
  -- v[col]=ans[row-1][col]+[row-1][col-1]
  -- push the vector into final 2d vector
  -- return the 2d vector 

CODE-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        for(int row=0;row<numRows;row++){
            vector<int>v (row+1,1);
            for(int col=1;col<row;col++){
                v[col]=ans[row-1][col]+ans[row-1][col-1];
            }
            ans.push_back(v);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
