228. Summary Ranges
description-  In this question we have given with the array, we have to return the ranges in which array is stored 
              Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
              Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
              Explanation: The ranges are:
              [0,2] --> "0->2"
              [4,5] --> "4->5"
              [7,7] --> "7"

              Basic idea here is, [0,2] are ranges which include [0,1,2] and these element are present in original array.
APPROACH 1::
  -- here we are going to use two pointer s=0, and i thorugh which we traverse the array 
  -- we traverse the array and check for nums[i]+1 != nums[i+1] if this true we add element to answer array according to question
  -- Here, we need to keep track of i pointer that should lie into array index only by adding check conditions
  -- return ans

CODE-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
       vector<string> ans;
        int s=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(i==nums.size()-1 || nums[i]+1 != nums[i+1]){
                if(nums[s]==nums[i]){
                    ans.push_back(to_string(nums[s]));
                }
                else{
                    ans.push_back(to_string(nums[s])+"->"+to_string(nums[i]));
                }
                if(i<nums.size()-1)
                    s=i+1;
            }
        }
        return ans; 
    }
};
